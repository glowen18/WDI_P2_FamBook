# Project 2 - FamBook

FamBook will be a website for families to:

* connect with family
* learn about family
* find out about upcoming events

### MVP

* The user will be able to create a secure login id and password.  
* The user will see a family tree with images of each family member.  
* The images will be clickable links that will take you to that person's content page.  
* On the person's content page will be a summary of the person with links to different stories.  
* Each story will have photos, videos and a place for a user to comment and/or connect with that family member.
