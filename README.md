# Project 2 - FamBook

FamBook will be a website for families to:

* Connect with family
* Learn about family
* Find out about upcoming events

### Approach

FamBook was created with Ruby on Rails and Postgresql using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

After generating a model in the rails console, the following steps were taken:

1. Confirm the migration data was correct
2. Create the routes
3. Code the model data
4. Code the controller data
5. Code the view data

The project consisted of coding an MVC for the User, Board and Story models. At each step a new Git Branch was created and tested in the browser.

After each modification, the changes were added, committed and pushed up to Github.
At the end of each day, the updated Github version was deployed using Heroku.

### MVP

* The user will be able to create a secure login and password.  

* The user will have CRUD functionality for it's user, boards and stories.

* On the user's Board page will be a table listing the user's Boards and Stories.
